lib.generators.toPlist: Make escaping optional as per PR comment

As discussed, this patch makes the following changes:

1. Escaping is only done when called with `{ escape = true; }`.
2. A warning is emitted if `{ escape = false; }`
3. Escaping is disabled by default, retaining backwards compatibility.

I have also added a test case for both the escaped and non-escaped
usage.
```
