Revert "wad wad wad"

This reverts commit 66309de2990a3e6512e2aea98d5afb9814375881.

It was only a temporary change because I needed the counter for
something. Just forgot to remove it afterwards.

Such temporary changes should become unnecessary in the future, since
the site rebuilds itself only on pushes as of
linnnus/nix-monorepo@3ac6c7a.
