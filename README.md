```
Add basic client-side validation to join-form

This patch adds some basic form-validation to the HTML for the join
page, namely making every input `required`.

I also took this opportunity to ensure the top-most option for roles
(DPS) isn't auto-selected. That could lead to some applicants skipping
the input field, since it's already filled with a (potentially wrong)
value.
